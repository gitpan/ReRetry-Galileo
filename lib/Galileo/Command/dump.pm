options: 

--directory,-d
  An optional directory to dump to may be specified; the directory 
  must exist. By default it dumps to the current working directory.

--title,-t
  By default the title of the page is included as an HTML comment.
  This option accepts an sprintf format for including the title.

  title is created.
